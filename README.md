# Smart Delivery Routing

![CI](https://github.com/phvghuy/smart-delivery-routing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A backend system for an e-commerce logistics platform. Manages the full lifecycle of a parcel — from the moment a seller creates a shipping request to final delivery at the customer's door — including hub-to-hub linehaul coordination and last-mile driver route assignment.

---

## Problem Statement

When a seller submits a shipping request, the system must:

1. Identify the nearest origin hub (to the pickup address) and destination hub (to the delivery address)
2. Track the parcel through 10 status transitions from pickup to delivery
3. Coordinate truck trips between hubs (linehaul)
4. Automatically assign delivery routes to available drivers and notify them in real time

---

## Architecture

The project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with five independent bounded contexts:

```
interface/api/        ← FastAPI routers, Pydantic schemas, dependency injection wiring
application/          ← Use cases (orchestration only, no infrastructure imports)
domain/
  ├── shipping/       ← ShippingRequest: orders submitted by sellers
  ├── linehaul/       ← Hub, Parcel, Truck, TruckTrip: inter-hub transport
  ├── delivery/       ← Driver, DeliveryRoute, RouteStop: last-mile delivery
  ├── tracking/       ← TrackingEvent: parcel status history
  └── shared/         ← Shared value objects: Address, Location, Load, Money
infrastructure/
  ├── supabase/       ← Concrete repository implementations (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
  ├── haversine.py    ← Distance matrix calculator for hub selection
  ├── telemetry.py    ← OpenTelemetry setup (traces exported to Jaeger)
  └── celery/         ← Async task: automatic delivery route generation
```

**Dependency rule:** Domain has no knowledge of infrastructure. Infrastructure implements abstract repository interfaces defined by the domain. Routers receive interfaces via `Depends()` — never concrete classes. All wiring is centralized in `dependencies.py`.

## Parcel Lifecycle

```
[Seller creates ShippingRequest]
            │
            ▼
  System finds nearest hubs (Haversine)
            │
      ┌─────┴─────┐
      │           │
  Both found   Not found
      │           │
  ACCEPTED     REJECTED
      │
      ▼
Parcel: AWAITING_PICKUP
        │
        ▼  driver picks up
      PICKED_UP
        │
        ▼  delivered to origin hub
    AT_ORIGIN_HUB
        │
        ▼  loaded onto truck
  IN_LINEHAUL_TRANSIT
        │
        ▼  truck arrives at destination
  AT_DESTINATION_HUB
        │
        ▼  driver assigned
   OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
        │
   ┌────┴─────┐
   │          │
DELIVERED  DELIVERY_FAILED → RETURNED
```

Every status transition creates a `TrackingEvent` recording the source location (driver / hub / truck / customer / system).

## Features

### Shipping
- Full request validation: addresses, load (weight + volume), receiver info, COD amount
- Automatic hub selection using Haversine distance across all active hubs
- Parcel creation and ACCEPTED/REJECTED status update handled atomically in a single use case

### Linehaul
- Hub management (types: sorting center, local hub)
- Truck management with weight and volume capacity
- Truck trip scheduling and tracking: PLANNED → DEPARTED → ARRIVED
- Add/remove parcels from a trip with real-time capacity checking

### Last-Mile Delivery
- Automatic route generation: parcels grouped by hub, drivers grouped by hub, greedy assignment by capacity
- Stop order optimized with nearest-neighbor algorithm (OSRM for real road distances, Haversine fallback)
- Drivers receive FCM push notifications when a route is assigned
- Admin receives real-time events via WebSocket
- Drivers update each stop: DELIVERED or FAILED (with a specific reason)

### Tracking
- Full event history for every parcel
- Each event records its location source type (driver, hub, truck, customer, system)

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- `.env` file (see below)
- `firebase-service-account.json` from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
- OSRM pre-processed map data (optional — Haversine is used as fallback)

### Environment Variables

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
OSRM_URL=http://osrm:5000
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=/app/firebase-service-account.json
```

### Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phvghuy/smart-delivery-routing
cd smart-delivery-routing

docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| API | http://localhost:8000 |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Jaeger UI | http://localhost:16686 |

### Run Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration" --tb=short
```

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs two parallel jobs on every push to `main`:

| Job | Steps |
|---|---|
| **lint** | `ruff check src/` — fails on any linting error |
| **test** | `pytest` with coverage report — fails if coverage drops below 30% |

---

## Observability

The system integrates **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger** for distributed tracing:

- Every HTTP request automatically generates a root span (FastAPI auto-instrumentation)
- Key use case steps are wrapped in child spans: hub nearest-neighbor lookup, parcel creation, batch linehaul dispatch
- Traces are exported to Jaeger via gRPC (OTLP protocol)
- View traces at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) after running `docker compose up`

---

## Design Decisions

**Haversine distance matrix for hub selection** — On shipping request creation, the system fetches all active hubs and places the target address at index 0 of the location list. `HaversineDistanceCalculator.compute_matrix()` returns an NxN matrix; `matrix[0][1:]` gives distances from the target to every hub in one pass. Reuses existing infrastructure instead of writing a separate nearest-hub function.

**Explicit state machine per transition** — Each of the 10 parcel status transitions has its own use case function (`pickup_parcel`, `deliver_to_origin_hub`, `dispatch_linehaul`...) rather than a generic `update_status`. Each transition carries different side effects: updating `current_hub_id`, clearing it, choosing the right `TrackingEvent` location type.

**Fake repository pattern in tests** — Unit tests use in-memory implementations of abstract repositories. No Supabase or Redis required. Tests that need external services are marked `@pytest.mark.integration` and skipped in CI.

**Centralized DI wiring** — `dependencies.py` is the only file that knows `SupabaseHubRepository` exists. Routers depend only on `HubRepository` (the abstract interface). Swapping the database layer requires changes in exactly one file.
